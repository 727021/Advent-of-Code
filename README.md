# Advent of Code

This is where I keep my solutions for the yearly Advent of Code puzzles. While I will branch out occasionally, most of the code here is written in JavaScript and run with Node.js.

To run my solutions, use the CLI tool built into this app. First run `npm install`, then `npm start`.

## CLI Comands

| Command        | Description                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| help [command] | List or display help for commands                    |
| year [year]    | Display or set the current year                      |
| run [day]      | Display available days or run the solution for a day |
| clear          | Clear the console window                             |
| quit           | Quit AoC                                             |
