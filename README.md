# Advent of Code

This is where I keep my solutions for the yearly Advent of Code puzzles. While I will branch out occasionally, most of the code here is written in JavaScript and run with Node.js.

Each year is its own Node.js app. Make sure you run `npm install` in a year's folder before you run any of my solutions. Solutions can be run with `npm run X`, where `X` is a number 1-25 representing the day whose challenges you want to run.
